Kodi (formerly XBMC) is a brilliant free multiplatform media player that also happens to be great for watching TV and films. It is the best open-source media-centre software availble today. The real power of Kodi lies in its Addons that enhances just about any aspect of your experience. You can add media source for Movies, TV Shows, Live Sports, Anime, Cartoons, News, Documentaries, Weather, Reviews, Skins, and numerous other content. 

Surprisingly, with all the flexibility, it suffers one major drawback. It is difficult to find the best content that you would like to watch?

Media-Sense is a Web interface for Kodi that allows you to manage what you watch. With Media-Sense you can: 
* Quickly find the best content, sorted on review ratings and genre. 
* Review more detail about the content, including plot outline, cast, studio, runtime and release date.
* Request Kodi to play the chosen conent imediately
* Or add the content to a personalised playlist for later review.
